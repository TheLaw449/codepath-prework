The reason I love these applications so much is due to their simplicity in terms of GUI and their practicality. They make the interface very easy to look at as well as very intuitive to navigate. When it comes to applications and they way the user interacts with them simplicity is key! 
## Notes
I encountered one issue when running the application which is something that held me back for quite a bit, my code was formatted incorrectly and the application would crash. I realized what I was doing wrong after some google searching and was able to fix it.
